## 'ft_printf'

![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-Completed-brightgreen)
![Score](https://img.shields.io/badge/score-125%2F100-blue)

A project to recreate the C library function printf, focusing on variadic functions and complex string formatting.


### `get_next_line`

![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-Completed-brightgreen)
![Score](https://img.shields.io/badge/score-125%2F100-blue)

This project consists of writing a function that returns a line read from a file descriptor. It's a great exercise to practice static variables and dynamic memory allocation.
