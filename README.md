### `libft`

![Score](https://img.shields.io/badge/score-125%2F100-blue)

A brief description of the project and its purpose. It's a fundamental library that I'll use in all future C projects at 42.

### `get_next_line`

![Score](https://img.shields.io/badge/score-100%2F100-blue)

This project consists of writing a function that returns a line read from a file descriptor. It's a great exercise to practice static variables and dynamic memory allocation.

### `push_swap`

A fascinating project where I need to sort data on a stack using a limited set of instructions, with the minimum number of moves possible.
